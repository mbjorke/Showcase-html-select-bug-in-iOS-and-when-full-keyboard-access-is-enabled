Go to Settings > Accessibility > Keyboards, tap Full Keyboard Access, then turn on Full Keyboard Access.

Open Safari browser on an iPhone (my example tested with iPhone 14 with iOS 17.1.2)

To experience the bug visit following showcase: https://mbjorke.github.io/Showcase-html-select-bug-in-iOS-and-when-full-keyboard-access-is-enabled/ (I'm the owner of this Github and the showcase was made by me)

Expected behaviour: The third select element on the page labeled “Choose another fruit” should be able to tab to with a connected keyboard.

Actual behaviour: The third select element on the page labeled “Choose another fruit” is not able to tab to with the connected keyboard.
